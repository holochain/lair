                   Note, this operation requires capturing the pid_file,
                   make sure you do not have a lair-server running.
                   Note, we currently only support importing seed bundles
                   with a pwhash cipher. We'll try the passphrase you
                   supply with all ciphers used to lock the bundle.
    init           Set up a new lair private keystore.
    server         Run a lair keystore server instance. Note you must
                   have initialized a config file first with
